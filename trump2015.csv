One of the dumbest political pundits on television is Chris Stirewalt of @FoxNews. Wrong facts - check Fox debate rankings Trump #1. Dope!,11/7/15,1299,3274
Would be nice if @jmartNYT learned how to read the polls before writing his next story. Probably done on purpose but not good reporting!,11/7/15,861,2055
