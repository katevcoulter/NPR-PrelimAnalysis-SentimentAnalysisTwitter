Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic,7/27/16,29880,84336

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!,7/27/16,16373,54039
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!,7/27/16,13024,40342
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!,7/27/16,15183,45670

I hate to say it but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!,7/27/16,10248,46692

Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.,7/26/16,8404,31866
Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great,7/26/16,20230,65045
Funny if you listen to @FoxNews the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two they are fawning. What a difference,7/26/16,7859,29741
Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.,7/26/16,22979,66440
Elizabeth Warren often referred to as Pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary who she always hated!,7/26/16,11683,42417
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.,7/26/16,23360,67692
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.,7/26/16,10005,34392
I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!,7/25/16,8264,26522
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time energy and money. The V.P. a joke!,7/25/16,8923,30371
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.,7/25/16,14640,44620
Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP is in pocket of Wall Street and backed Iraq War.,7/25/16,8719,24521

Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA,7/25/16,10427,35655
The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!,7/25/16,8078,29347
Wow the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!,7/25/16,11967,41729
Here we go again with another Clinton scandal and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in B never had a chance!,7/25/16,9475,30262
"Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her ""servant"" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught that's all! They laughed at Bernie.",7/25/16,9121,27616
If Bernie Sanders after seeing the just released e-mails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same.,7/25/16,5352,20157
Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam,7/25/16,17329,50219
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!,7/25/16,7590,26452
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails using even religion against Bernie!,7/25/16,7098,24296
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails which should never have been written (stupid) because Putin likes me,7/25/16,9673,32116
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!,7/24/16,10029,33121
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good but for the final night my speech great. Thank you!,7/24/16,5986,29413
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory she's out!,7/24/16,9502,30435
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!,7/24/16,13136,35108
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!,7/24/16,8118,28299
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out,7/24/16,5500,19848
If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie) media would go wild,7/24/16,11340,32450
The @CNN panels are so one sided almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!,7/24/16,9400,30900
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left!,7/24/16,7457,25061
Today proves what I have always known that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.),7/24/16,7067,24301
Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!,7/24/16,9571,29158
"There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end!",7/24/16,9109,27352
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.,7/24/16,10994,29097
Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not their BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!,7/24/16,6644,21513
Wow President Obama's brother Malik just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!,7/24/16,33678,87337
Bernie Sanders started off strong but with the selection of Kaine for V.P. is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT,7/24/16,5678,19859
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!,7/24/16,6739,23968

Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!,7/23/16,6857,32709
The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud!,7/23/16,14734,36646
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!,7/23/16,9547,31974
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!,7/23/16,10316,34772
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!,7/23/16,8064,22105
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!,7/23/16,9432,30648
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.,7/23/16,9054,26638
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes really vicious. RIGGED,7/23/16,23961,53145
Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also Crooked Hillary hates her!,7/23/16,8359,27703
Tim Kaine is and always has been owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!,7/23/16,10005,26964
The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?,7/23/16,7467,24020
I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.,7/23/16,8146,21840
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?,7/23/16,12935,30512
Another attack this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.,7/22/16,11083,39750
One of the best produced including the incredible stage &amp; set in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRove,7/22/16,5643,25531

By the way Hillary &amp; the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the Al-Shabaab terror video. https://t.co/gRannsRXJr,1/3/16,4166,7030
The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.,1/3/16,3403,9300

Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!,1/3/16,17960,32185
Al-Shabbab not ISIS just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner &amp; if I speak out against them which I must. Hillary lied!,1/3/16,2682,6688

Remember I am self-funding my campaign the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!,1/2/16,6065,15803
When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!,1/2/16,3745,9075
I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!,1/2/16,3609,8017

Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!,1/2/16,7832,14673
